## Session description
Too often, we chuck talented technologists into a promotion to the role of team lead or manager without any training or support. This can lead to a shaky foundation in their management style, many new managers quitting to go back to tech, and people being mis-handled as managers learn. In this session, I'll take you through some of the concepts, frameworks, and support systems I think help a company grow great leaders. This is a great session for existing leaders but useful for those who are "management-curious" and want to see what's involved.
