## Session description
Ten years ago, I began advocating for **DataOps**, a framework designed to improve collaboration, efficiency, and agility in data management. The industry was still grappling with fragmented workflows, slow delivery cycles, and a disconnect between data teams and business needs. Fast forward to today, and the landscape has transformed, but have we truly embraced the future of working with data at scale?
