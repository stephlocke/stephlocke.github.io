## Session description
Between spending hours (or days!) making sure you can code and test locally and the difficulties of keeping remote environments up to date, sometimes we find ourselves falling back on "It works on my machine!". Getting rid of the difficulties in making new development environments and maintaining testing infrastructure is really key to banishing the dreaded phrase. In this session, we'll take you through some of the recent tools and techs that will not only make your life easier but will mean you never have to say "works on my machine" ever again.
