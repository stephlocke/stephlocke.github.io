See the slides for the session at Talks/Working with data using Azure Functions.
What are Azure Functions? Azure Functions are one of the latest abstractions away from needing to define everything yourself when performing activities using software.
First we abstracted away from the physical server to the virtual, then started using Platform as a Service (PaaS) or containerising code to run in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Codespaces for Hugo development</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/blog/using-codespaces-for-hugo-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/blog/using-codespaces-for-hugo-development/</guid><description>In this blog post, I try using Github Codespaces to write this blog post about using Codespaces to write blog posts in Hugo!

Last year was a period of reflection for both Nightingale HQ and myself. What do we want to be and where should we be spending our time? The answer for Nightingale HQ (NHQ) is a change towards more of a blended product and services offering in the manufacturing space. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s gaining a stronger foundation in technology leadership.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Hey hey!
