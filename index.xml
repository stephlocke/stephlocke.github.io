See the slides for the session at Talks/Working with data using Azure Functions.
What are Azure Functions? Azure Functions are one of the latest abstractions away from needing to define everything yourself when performing activities using software.
First we abstracted away from the physical server to the virtual, then started using Platform as a Service (PaaS) or containerising code to run in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Working with data using Azure Functions</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/working_with_data_using_azure_functions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/working_with_data_using_azure_functions/</guid><description>Session description Azure Functions are great for a wide range of scenarios, including working with data on a transactional or event-driven basis. In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how you can interact with Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, and more so you can see how you can take a lightweight but code-first approach to building APIs, integrations, ETL, and maintenance routines.

This can lead to a shaky foundation in their management style, many new managers quitting to go back to tech, and people being mis-handled as managers learn. In this session, I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through some of the concepts, frameworks, and support systems I think help a company grow great leaders.</description></item><item><title>Letâ€™s banish "it works on my machine"</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/works_on_my_machine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/works_on_my_machine/</guid><description>Session description Between spending hours (or days!) making sure you can code and test locally and the difficulties of keeping remote environments up to date, sometimes we find ourselves falling back on &amp;ldquo;It works on my machine!&amp;rdquo;. Getting rid of the difficulties in making new development environments and maintaining testing infrastructure is really key to banishing the dreaded phrase. In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll take you through some of the recent tools and techs that will not only make your life easier but will mean you never have to say &amp;ldquo;works on my machine&amp;rdquo; ever again.</description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Codespaces for Hugo development</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/blog/using-codespaces-for-hugo-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/blog/using-codespaces-for-hugo-development/</guid><description>In this blog post, I try using Github Codespaces to write this blog post about using Codespaces to write blog posts in Hugo! Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s meta ðŸ¤“
A GitHub Codespace is a cloud based developer environment attached to your GitHub repository. It contains the necessary dependencies to be able to work on your codebase in VS Code (in-browser or you can connect from your desktop!) and then commit your code. Having a Codespace means never having to get all those pesky project dependencies set up on your computer AND it means you&amp;rsquo;re always working from a clean environment so &amp;ldquo;Works on my machine&amp;rdquo; should be a thing of the past!</description></item><item><title>Developer Velocity</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/developer_velocity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/developer_velocity/</guid><description>Session description Join Steph and Chris as they run through Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s transformation from shipping boxed products to always-on online services. Developer Velocity is a critical part of that journey to ensure the teams can keep delivering value to their end-users at scale. In this session, you will learn about some of the tips &amp;amp; tricks that Microsoft used along the way.

What I&amp;rsquo;d like to do in this blog post, is cover some ways to make Teams easier day to day, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate lots of extra noise, anxiety, and context switching.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Solution Architect Manager</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/msft-csamgr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 09:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/msft-csamgr/</guid><description>Leading a team to foster Digital &amp;amp; Application Innovation at scale.</description></item><item><title>Joining Microsoft</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/blog/new-role-at-msft/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/blog/new-role-at-msft/</guid><description>Over the past five years I&amp;rsquo;ve been running my own consultancy and software companies. Last year was a period of reflection for both Nightingale HQ and myself. What do we want to be and where should we be spending our time? The answer for Nightingale HQ (NHQ) is a change towards more of a blended product and services offering in the manufacturing space. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s gaining a stronger foundation in technology leadership.</description></item><item><title>Chair</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-chair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-chair/</guid><description>Chairing the Board to support Nightingale HQ&amp;rsquo;s growth plans.</description></item><item><title>Non-Executive Director</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/sqlsat-nonexec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/sqlsat-nonexec/</guid><description>Supporting the setup of the new SQL Saturday not-for-profit.</description></item><item><title>CEO</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/lockedata-ceo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 12:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/lockedata-ceo/</guid><description>The founder of Locke Data, I help businesses build a data science capability.</description></item><item><title>CEO</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-ceo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 12:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-ceo/</guid><description>The co-founder of Nightingale HQ, I build solutions that support manufacturers in their digital transformation.</description></item><item><title>Community support</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/community/</guid><description>Hi!</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://stephlocke.info/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephlocke.info/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Hey hey!
