See the slides for the session at Talks/Working with data using Azure Functions.
What are Azure Functions? Azure Functions are one of the latest abstractions away from needing to define everything yourself when performing activities using software.

In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how you can interact with Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, and more so you can see how you can take a lightweight but code-first approach to building APIs, integrations, ETL, and maintenance routines.
