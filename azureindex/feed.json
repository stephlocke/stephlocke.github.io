Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s meta 🤓\nA GitHub Codespace is a cloud based developer environment attached to your GitHub repository. It contains the necessary dependencies to be able to work on your codebase in VS Code (in-browser or you can connect from your desktop!) and then commit your code. Having a Codespace means never having to get all those pesky project dependencies set up on your computer AND it means you\u0026rsquo;re always working from a clean environment so \u0026ldquo;Works on my machine\u0026rdquo; should be a thing of the past! Awesome, right?!\nSo now that I have the ability to create a Codespace I figured I\u0026rsquo;d give it a go rather than installing Hugo on my new work machine, git cloning, and so on. I also opted to not read the docs to see if it really was as easy as the marketing said it was!\nFirst of all there was a button that said simply Create codespace on main and I thought \u0026ldquo;Nah, it can\u0026rsquo;t be that simple right?\u0026rdquo;. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d need to take the Configure and create codespace option instead to get into to telling it to install Hugo etc. Well this took me to a wizard that gave me only a few options (branch, region, and machine type) and all of it was set appropriately so I pressed Create codespace and away I went. It took less than a minute and then I was looking at VS Code in the browser!\n This was an editable instance of my codebase and I\u0026rsquo;d noticed it had created a .hugo_build.lock filte and few directories like resources but I figured that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all my Hugo dependencies so I\u0026rsquo;d better learn how to create a custom codespace so I started clicking on the links in the terminal about custom containers.\nI had just created a branch via the Codespace where I intended to both write this blog post and build my custom container, when I decided \u0026ldquo;What the heck, see if Hugo works in the terminal\u0026rdquo; and with a quick type of hugo that container took 166ms to generate my entire blog site. Wow!\nKnowing that I may not have to build a custom container at all, I\u0026rsquo;ve progressed the blog post to this point. My next step is to see what will happen if I run hugo serve \u0026ndash; will I be able to access the live preview of the site?\nDrumroll please\u0026hellip;\nI can! 👏👏\nThere is now a Ports tab available where I can see it active and it gave me a popup with a big green button that opened up my site.\n Brilliant, it worked. Browsing to my site I can see it\u0026rsquo;s generated the blog post and so on. The problem I now have is that the image isn\u0026rsquo;t rendering because it\u0026rsquo;s looking for localhost:1313 in the image URL and I get a similar issue when I click through to the post itself.\n This is a bit of a hiccup but this is to do with my love of generating absolute URLs versus relative URLs and Hugo starting with the default base URL of http://localhost:1313. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can change that to the URL of the preview page Codespace generated (stephlocke-stephlocke-github-io-wrggw7rjh6g9-1313.githubpreview.dev).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve just run hugo serve -b https://stephlocke-stephlocke-github-io-wrggw7rjh6g9-1313.githubpreview.dev and it worked! Well sort of. 🤔 Unfortunately, Hugo is still injecting the port into some URLs and it isn\u0026rsquo;t something I can just use the terminal to get around. It\u0026rsquo;s down to how I\u0026rsquo;ve coded the shortcodes and partials in Hugo. I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo modules to bring in the theme so I\u0026rsquo;m not able to edit the theme as easily as I would if it was a git submodule or something I kept in the repo. I guess tidying the theme up whilst in Codepaces is a topic for a future blog post.\nFor now though, I\u0026rsquo;m able to get started with Hugo in-browser in less than a minute making it so that I can author new content much more easily. 😍 Hopefully, that\u0026rsquo;ll mean I blog more! It was incredibly simple to get up and running with the only real change I had to make to accomodate my specific blog setup was to change the base URL when serving the Hugo site. It\u0026rsquo;s really quite amazing how easy it all was.\nThank you for reading this text-based live stream of me trying out this snazzy new tool. 🙏\n","tags":["Hugo","GitHub","Codespaces","Developer Velocity"],"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/tags/analytics/","title":"Analytics","date_published":"2022-05-04T09:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, May 4, 2022 9:00 AM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/tags/cloud/","title":"Cloud","date_published":"2022-05-04T09:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, May 4, 2022 9:00 AM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/presenting/talks/developer_velocity/","title":"Developer Velocity","date_published":"2022-05-04T09:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, May 4, 2022 9:00 AM","description":"Session description Join Steph and Chris as they run through Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s transformation from shipping boxed products to always-on online services.

What I\u0026rsquo;d like to do in this blog post, is cover some ways to make Teams easier day to day, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate lots of extra noise, anxiety, and context switching.\n1. Does it spark joy? Q. Are you hoarding Teams you\u0026rsquo;re a member of even if you\u0026rsquo;re not using them any more? A. Bin it! You can leave a team by clicking on the ellipsis (the \u0026hellip; symbol). You can always join again later if you need to.\nQ. Afraid to be spotted leaving a team even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t spark joy, you never look at it, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need anything from it? A. You can select the Hide team in the ellipsis (the \u0026hellip; symbol) to Hide the channel to add it to an easily collapsible section.\n Q. Are there a bunch of channels that you don\u0026rsquo;t care about in a Team you do use regularly? A. You can hide the channels by clicking on the ellipsis (the \u0026hellip; symbol). Whilst you\u0026rsquo;re at it, select Off in the Channel notifications so only direct mentions and replies will generate noise.\n2. Could it be a \u0026lt;X\u0026gt; instead? Q. Are you making channels (or worse Teams!) for every topic even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t needed long term? A. Stop! Get rid of those excess channels by clicking on the ellipsis (the \u0026hellip; symbol) and selecting \u0026ldquo;Delete this channel\u0026rdquo;. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it feel good to get rid of the clutter? Next up, use chat for short term stuff with a selection of people or create a conversation with a subject line inside a more general channel if the audience has strong overlap with a channel.\nQ. Are you using chats for dozens of people for more than a month? Are you reusing a meeting chat for all the things? A. Convert to a Team if isn\u0026rsquo;t an existing Team that the members of the chat already belong to. If there is a place all the chat members already belong to, make a channel for the discussion. Remember, Teams channels can be deleted later so this is a great option for longer term conversations.\n Q. Are you using a chat to collaborate with multiple people outside your business on a project or on an ongoing basis? A. Use a Shared channel to talk to each other. This gives you the full breadth of Teams functionality, including associating meetings to it so you can see recordings more easily.\nQ. Is it taking forever to make a decision or coordinate something? A. Consider moving to synchronous communication e.g. a Teams call or meeting, to discuss more quickly.\n Q. Are people posting weekly updates about the same thing, managing tasks, or other sort of activities that involve repeatedly restating or reusing things? A. Make a tab for that! Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a OneNote, a wiki, a Task list, a Power BI app or something else, just make a reusable area for that activity to happen.\n3. How can we make the noise stop? Q. Are notifications duplicating on your desktop and your mobile device? A. Select your avatar in the mobile app and then select notifications. the quickest way to ensure Teams never hassles you on the device is to set the quiet hours to all day, every day. If you want notifications sometimes, you can instead use the quiet hours, the notification types, plus the desktop and meetings toggles to make a more sophisticated notification setup.\nQ. Are you getting lots of pings from channel mentions? A. This is a classic noisy restaurant scenario \u0026ndash; folks aren\u0026rsquo;t reading my standard channel messages so I start pinging the channel, now other folks need to ping the channel to get their message noticed, and so on, until everyone is pinging in every message! To get out of this cycle, you need to first break the cycle yourself \u0026ndash; stop pinging channels if your message is not urgent and whilst your message may take a while to get read but that\u0026rsquo;s OK, asynchronous communication is meant to be asynchronous. Next up, you need to help others reduce the noise they\u0026rsquo;re feeling so they can stop escalating too. Start by sharing this post or other helpful articles to support them in reducing the noise Teams generates.\nQ. Is the Activity tab in overdrive? A. There\u0026rsquo;s a number of ways to address this. One is first getting through your unreads \u0026ndash; the filter icon (three horizontal lines that shrink from top to bottom) can be clicked on and then the ellipsis selected to filter to specific types of activity. Use this to tackle more important types of activity first like all Unread, only Mentions, or Replies. The second thing you can do is stop so much stuff showing up in the feed. To reduce the events that show up in the Activity feed, select the cog icon next to the filter icon on the feed. Go through Teams and channels, plus Chat, and so on to customise notifications. I generally recommend making most notification types set to \u0026ldquo;Only show in feed\u0026rdquo; except stuff like Likes and reactions which I set to Off.\nQ. Are people full of jibber jabber after a meeting or on a chat and you don\u0026rsquo;t really care about what\u0026rsquo;s being said? A. You can mute a chat whether a standalone chat or a meeting chat by clicking on the ellipsis (the \u0026hellip; symbol) and selecting Mute.\n Q. Are people cross-posting everywhere? A. Ban hammer! 🔨 In seriousness, most people who cross-post i.e. post the same message to multiple places, typically do so because they think there are different audiences in those places. Stop and think if that is indeed the case before getting stressed at them. If they\u0026rsquo;re doing the more heinous activity of posting the same thing in multiple channels within the same team, gently educate them about the fact that everyone can see every channel and if things are important for an audience larger than niche channel, that they should post on General instead.\n4. How can you be more proactive to stop it getting so noisy? Q. Are there too many unreads for you to face right now? A. Alas, there is no way to mark all unreads messages as read in Teams right now. 😿 That being said you don\u0026rsquo;t have to get everything under control at once. Commit five minutes a day or when you\u0026rsquo;re between meetings to chip away at the backlog.\nQ. Want to keep the the situation from getting bad again? A. You need to declutter and reduce notifications first so that the volume ofincoming messages/notifications is easier to deal with. After the tidy up, keeping it clean means committing to Teams-0 where you check in on Teams at certain points in the day and read anything unread. This is a great habit to get into instead of letting Teams ping you constantly as it means you don\u0026rsquo;t need to context switch all the time. Make sure the teams and channels you care about are all marked as read before you go, and if there\u0026rsquo;s too many to do that because you\u0026rsquo;re at the beginning of tackling this, see the question above!\nQ. Are people pinging you repeatedly or, worse, calling you because you\u0026rsquo;re not responding quickly enough? 😱 A. Expectations about urgency and message read frequency need to be set. A great way to do this is to set your status message. To set your status, select your avatar and then edit the status message. Make sure to set it to stay there for more than a day!\n Q. Are you a multi-message offender? A. If you break up your message into seperate paragraphs and hit Send between each one, you\u0026rsquo;re part of the problem. 😜 Craft the whole message and then send it as one so that people don\u0026rsquo;t receive multiple notifications and don\u0026rsquo;t sit around waiting for you to finally finish whatever it is you wanted to say. If someone else you know is a multi-message offender, start with introducing them to nohello.\n5. What should you do next? This post was by no means exhaustive of tips and tricks to help make remote asynchronous communication less difficult to maintain. The main longer term tasks I\u0026rsquo;d recommend are:\n Politely educate and support others in getting out of message hell Make sure to keep an eye for Teams updates that can help you Regularly ask yourself \u0026ldquo;Could this be a better in some other other format?\u0026rdquo; Check out this broader Teams etiquette guide  Please feel free to share your tips, trials, and tribulations with me on Twitter!\n ","tags":["Teams","remote work"],"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/tags/teams/","title":"Teams","date_published":"2022-04-06T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, April 6, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/msft-csamgr/","title":"Cloud Solution Architect Manager","date_published":"2022-03-07T09:25:00Z","date_published_display":"Monday, March 7, 2022 9:25 AM","description":"Leading a team to foster Digital \u0026amp; Application Innovation at scale.","content":"2022 \u0026ndash; Current\nManage and develop a team of Digital \u0026amp; Application Innovation Cloud Solution Architects (CSA) to drive digital transformation through tech intensity at scale for global customers.\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/tags/career/","title":"career","date_published":"2022-03-03T09:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Thursday, March 3, 2022 9:00 AM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/blog/new-role-at-msft/","title":"Joining Microsoft","date_published":"2022-03-03T09:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Thursday, March 3, 2022 9:00 AM","description":"Over the past five years I\u0026rsquo;ve been running my own consultancy and software companies.

Last year was a period of reflection for both Nightingale HQ and myself. What do we want to be and where should we be spending our time? The answer for Nightingale HQ (NHQ) is a change towards more of a blended product and services offering in the manufacturing space. For me, it\u0026rsquo;s gaining a stronger foundation in technology leadership. To that end, Ruth will be stepping up to the role of CEO for NHQ and I\u0026rsquo;m moving to a role within Microsoft.\nMicrosoft I\u0026rsquo;m going to be leading a team of Digital \u0026amp; Application Innovation Cloud Solution Architects (CSA). Part of the Customer Success Unit (CSU), the goal of the team is to support successful digital transformation in UK organisations. I\u0026rsquo;ll be working to both scale the effectiveness of technologists whilst delivering supporting customers in achieving strategic technology adoption.\nNHQ I\u0026rsquo;m moving to the role of Chair for NHQ\u0026rsquo;s Board, acting in an oversight and advisory capacity. Ruth will be taking over as the CEO and will be responsible for growing the business into the technology areas and geographical focus that the last year of trading has been testing.\nLocke Data Over the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing small engagements via my consultancy Locke Data. This will be closing and I have referred many of customers to either Jumping Rivers or Advancing Analytics. I have left my blogs, talks, and other materials available for access. I hope the open-source contributions the consultancy has made over the years continues to have value for the data platform and data science communities.\nTech community The past five years have been tough but wonderful to contribute to the technology community. Between entrepreneurship and COVID, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been easy and at times I feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t done very much. In recognition of my changing focus, I have found homes for many of my open-source projects since I no longer code enough in those languages to keep them up to date. I\u0026rsquo;ll be continuing to the support the SQL Saturday not-for-profit which is starting to come out of hibernation as COVID has become more manageable.\nI hold a strong interest in helping the squishy parts of the systems (a.k.a. humans) work more effectively. The interest in [Something]Ops over the years plays into this \u0026ndash; how do we work more effectively with technology to deliver value? With that in mind I fully expect to continue talking about the concept of developer velocity with both Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s customers and the broader technology communities that I love to be a part of. As I start my new role and get up to speed, I fully expect to re-engage the tech community with talks, blog posts, and open-source contributions again.\n","tags":["career"],"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-chair/","title":"Chair","date_published":"2022-03-02T11:25:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, March 2, 2022 11:25 AM","description":"Chairing the Board to support Nightingale HQ\u0026rsquo;s growth plans.","content":"2022 \u0026ndash; Current\nThe co-founder of Nightingale HQ, now head up the Board.\nnightingalehq.ai\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/sqlsat-nonexec/","title":"Non-Executive Director","date_published":"2022-03-02T11:25:00Z","date_published_display":"Wednesday, March 2, 2022 11:25 AM","description":"Supporting the setup of the new SQL Saturday not-for-profit.","content":"2021 \u0026ndash; Current\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/lockedata-ceo/","title":"CEO","date_published":"2022-02-20T12:25:00Z","date_published_display":"Sunday, February 20, 2022 12:25 PM","description":"The founder of Locke Data, I help businesses build a data science capability.","content":"2016 \u0026ndash; 2022\nThe founder of Locke Data, I help businesses build a data science capability.\nitsalocke.com\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/nightingalehq-ceo/","title":"CEO","date_published":"2022-02-20T12:25:00Z","date_published_display":"Sunday, February 20, 2022 12:25 PM","description":"The co-founder of Nightingale HQ, I build solutions that support manufacturers in their digital transformation.","content":"2018 \u0026ndash; 2022\nThe co-founder of Nightingale HQ, I help build solutions that support manufacturers in their digital transformation.\nnightingalehq.ai\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/blog/","title":"Blog","date_published":"2022-02-18T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Friday, February 18, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/tags/blogging/","title":"blogging","date_published":"2022-02-18T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Friday, February 18, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/community/","title":"Community support","date_published":"2022-02-18T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Friday, February 18, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"Hi!","content":"Hi!\n","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/resume/","title":"CV","date_published":"2022-02-18T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Friday, February 18, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"","content":"","tags":null,"image":"https://stephlocke.info/icons/sl.png"},{"url":"https://stephlocke.info/blog/hello-world/","title":"Hello World!","date_published":"2022-02-18T12:00:00Z","date_published_display":"Friday, February 18, 2022 12:00 PM","description":"Hey hey!
