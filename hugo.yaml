      Hi, I'm Steph Locke, a creator of great teams, meaningful products, and impactful services through inclusive leadership and expertise in the fundamentals and the cutting-edge of technology.

      With a career spanning over a decade, I have consistently made a difference through the teams I build and the products and services we create. My journey began with startups and evolved through significant roles at Microsoft, where I honed my inclusive leadership skills and deep technical acumen. I am passionate about driving digital transformation and leveraging AI to create innovative solutions that align with core priorities.

      Currently, I serve as the Chair at Nightingale HQ, where I oversee governance and compliance, and advise on AI products that assist manufacturers in achieving Net Zero emissions. Prior to this, I led a team of pre-sales engineers at Microsoft, developing AI applications and modernisation solutions for the UK's largest organisations. My leadership expanded the team from 7 to 15 members in just eight months, ensuring high performance and diversity.

      As the CEO of Nightingale HQ, I created and grew a startup focused on digital transformation programmes and no-code AI-driven process products for the manufacturing space. My efforts led to the development of a SaaS platform and AI-powered tools used by over 100 organisations. I also served as the CEO of Locke Data, where I supported organisations in delivering data science programmes and contributed to open-source initiatives.

      Throughout my career, I have been a trusted advisor and thought leader, providing training and services to prestigious institutions like Microsoft, Cambridge University, and Cancer Research UK. My contributions to the field have been recognized with awards such as CEO of the Year from Welsh SME Business Awards and Most Innovative Woman in AI - UK from AI Influential Businesswoman Awards.

      I am committed to fostering an inclusive culture and driving impactful change through technology. Let's connect and explore how we can create meaningful products and services together.
